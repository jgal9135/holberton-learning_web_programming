  <font size="4" color="black" style="font-family:New Century Schoolbook, serif">The Gal is also known as Julia Gallaway. She is a seventeen year old girl and will be a senior at Bishop O'Dowd High School <br> this upcoming 2017-2018 school year. She is beginning to apply for college and continues to research schools all across the nation. <br> Julia enjoys many activities such as volunteering, playing sports, gardening, and of course, cooking! She began cooking when she was little, <br> standing on her stool, adding ingredients while her mother watches over and teaches Julia how to make the perfect dish. <br> Julia owes her cooking career to her mother especially, along with her father, grandmothers, and aunts.</font></div>

  <font size="4" color="black" style="font-family:New Century Schoolbook, serif">Julia Gallaway attends <a href="http://www.bishopodowd.org/" target="_blank">Bishop O'Dowd High School</a> located at 9500 Stearns Ave., Oakland, California. <br> She will be a 12th grader in the upcoming 2017-2018 school year. Bishop O'Dowd is a Catholic college <br> prepatory school that offers  many opportunities for all students such as athletics, drama, debate, and <br> a sustainablity club. Julia is a part of or hopes to be a part of all these options. The sustainability club is <br>  one of her favorites! She works with other students to promote sustainability and help in O'Dowd's <br> four acre "Living Lab." Actually, Bishop O'Dowd was recognized as a U.S. Department of Education <br> Green Ribbon School for reducing its environmental impact, receiving awards in 2014, 2015, and 2016. <br> Julia is very proud to be a part of this!</font></div>

  <font size="4" color="black" style="font-family:New Century Schoolbook, serif">Julia had lots of fun creating this website! She is quite glad that she was able to make it based on something that she truly loves: cooking. In cooking, <br> there are so many different elements that can be found in cooking--the colors, the cultures, the tastes. Food can be an inspiration or <br> a relaxant for her. Although eating the food is awesome, Julia absolutely enjoys the act of cooking. She turns her music up high and dances around <br> the kitchen as she makes her creation. Julia wanted to construct this website to be able to share her recipes with the world, enabling others <br> to feel the same joy she feels when she cooks. Julia hopes you enjoy Chow with the Gal!</font></div>
